# **This is not my code!** The original plugin was removed from GitHub at some point. This is a mirror. It has issues that I may fix at a later date, but for now, this is as you would have downloaded it from the original repository. All credit goes to [Telepathics](https://github.com/telepathics/) :)

# YOURLS Emojis
A YOURLS plugin that allows emojis in the custom short URLs.
## Description
Emojis in domain names and URLs are becoming increasingly popular, so I thought it would be fun to be able to include them in your YOURLS shortcodes.
